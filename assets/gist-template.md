# Hex Value Regex Tutorial

In this tutorial I will be explaining the functionality of a regex (specific regular expression). I will be breaking down the regex and explaining what each component consists of and what each component does.

## Summary

In this example we will be breaking down a regular expression that matches hex values.

For example we are going to create a rejex to find a specific color or catch an error if the parameters were not met in hex format. The following rejex will validate whether or not the hex code is valid.

Hex Value Rejex: `/^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/`

It may look confusing now but we are going to break down the rejex to further explain what the rejex does.

### Anchors

`/^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/`

Anchor in our example: ^ , $

Its purpose: Matches the position before `^` or the position after `$` a character. Checks if the string matches a pattern.

### Quantifiers

`/^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/`

Quantifier in our example: `?`

Its purpose: Specifies how many instances a character, group, or class must be present.

### Grouping Constructs

`/^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/`

Grouping construct in our example:

Its purpose:

### Bracket Expressions

`/^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/`

Bracket expression in our example:

Its purpose:

### Character Classes

`/^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/`

Character class in our example:

Its purpose:

### The OR Operator

`/^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/`

OR operator in our example:

Its purpose?

### Flags

`/^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/`

Flag in our example?

Its purpose?

### Character Escapes

`/^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/`

Character escape in our example?

Its purpose?
